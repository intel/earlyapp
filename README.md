## Earlyapp in UEFI environment

1. Service enablement for splash video:

  ```shell
  $ sudo systemctl enable earlyapp_gst.target
  ```

2. Using camera on runtime

   Pre-requisite: export XDG_RUNTIME_DIR, WAYLAND_DISPLAY and GST_PLUGIN_PATH

  ```shell
  $ src/earlyapp --use-gstreamer --camera-input test 
  ```
